excerpt: >-
  In this paper, multiple frames captured with a high-speed cameras were used to
  estimate the illuminant of the image. The proposed method exploits amplitude
  map generated from sinusoidal regression to estimate the varying intensity of
  the AC light. The proposed network consists of two subnets that estimate local
  illuminant and their respective confidence maps which are combined into a
  weighted sum to estimate the illuminant of the image.
