Hi! I’m Wooil, a first-year MS student at UCSD studying Electrical and Computer Engineering! I have 3 years of industry experience as a Machine Learning engineer at LG, with a strong background in speech and audio. Currently, I am researching new and novel ways to improve reasoning in LLMs.

My current research interests are: latent space reasoning, agentic AI, RAG, and LLMs as reasoners.

I am currently looking for a 2026 summer internship, so feel free to contact me at w3jung@ucsd.edu!

I routinely update my CV, with the current version updated at February 06th, 2026.
